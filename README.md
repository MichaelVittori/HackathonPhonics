Note: This app is hosted on a free plan of render, as such it may take a while for the service to spin up and load the app.

There has been an influx in content created by teachers focused on how k-12 students are struggling to read and write, so the goal of this project was to create something that will help younger children learn how to spell simple words.
This is accomplished using a list of pictures (animal emojis), and a prompt for the student to type the name of the animal. If the child doesn't know the animal they can click a button that will play its name and help them sound out the animal's name.

Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React

Our initial plans included a Flask backend which is still present in this repo, however this was unneccessary for the scope of the hackathon product. As a result all data and functionality is stored in the frontend.
